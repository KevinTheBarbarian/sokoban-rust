# sokoban-rust
This is a solver for sokoban puzzles, written in Rust. Sokoban is a hard problem (complexity-wise) and this version doesn't solve very hard problems yet. This is mostly for practice and to try some techniques I've been thinking of related to solving these kinds of search problems more generally.
